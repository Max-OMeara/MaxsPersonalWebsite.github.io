            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Max O'Meara, a dedicated and enthusiastic software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor of
                Arts in Computer Science at Boston University. My journey in computer science began at Lehigh
                University, where I studied for a year before transferring to BU.</p>
            <p>I have a robust technical skill set, including proficiency in Java, Python, React, C, C++, PHP, MySQL,
                JavaScript,
                HTML, and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy athletics, travel, and coffee. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to
                learn and grow, both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out via email. I'm excited to connect with like-minded
                professionals and explore new opportunities in the tech industry.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>This contains a complete list of projects I have completed from 2022-2024.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="project9.html">Terrier Tickets</a>
                    <p>2024</p>

                <p>Meow meow meow</p>
                <li><a href="project8.html">Sorting Algorithm Visualizer</a>
                    <p>2024</p>
                    <p>This project is used to help me memorize and visualize sorting algorithms. Created as a React
                        application
                        and uses JavaScript to create the visualizations. I use this project to help me understand React
                        as
                        well as more advanced
                        JavaScript concepts. I plan to add more sorting algorithms and features to the project in the
                        future
                        as quicksort and insertion
                        sort are currently unimplemented. In the future I may plan on adding a binary tree visualization
                        as
                        well.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <p>Created a basic log in page using PHP, CSS. Allows user to update information and log in. Used
                    MySQL to store user information. Created to learn PHP. I had plans to expand the project to be a
                    personal finance tracker
                    but ran out of time and had to move on to other projects.

                </li>
                <p>Assembled a personal carbon footprint tracker with a team of 4 during Boston Hacks Hackathon.
                    Consulted with teammates to program an HTML application that takes the user’s weekly commutes and
                    calculates their carbon footprint using Google Maps API and their mode of transport.

                </li>
                <p>Independently crafted a Java-based electricity billing system during the summer after my first year
                    of college. This project showcases proficiency in Java, MySQL, and various Java frameworks,
                    providing users with the capability to manage their electricity bills by inputting their usage data.

                    program asks the user what directory they want sorted and user is able to type file name in or
                    search for it and the program sorts the files into directories based on their file type.</p>
